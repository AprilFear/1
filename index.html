    <h1>AprilFear</h1>
    <p>
      It was April 1st, many years ago — a date etched into my bones. I was only nine. A soft boy. The kind others often overlooked. I wasn’t the loudest, or the fastest, or the bravest. I was just… kind. I liked quiet spaces. I wrote poems in the back of my notebooks and drew pictures of stars crying.
      <br><br>
      That morning started like any other. A bowl of cereal. My favorite hoodie. The radio playing some cheerful song in the background. But there was a strange feeling in my chest — like the calm before a storm. I didn’t know it yet, but that would be the last normal morning of my life.
      <br><br>
      The first prank came early. A classmate switched my water bottle with vinegar. I spat it out and the whole class erupted in laughter. I forced a smile. It stung more than the taste.
      <br><br>
      The second prank was crueler. Someone left a fake note in my locker saying my dog had died. I ran to the office, shaking, begging to call home. The secretary just chuckled and said, "April Fools, sweetheart."
      <br><br>
      But it didn’t stop there.
      <br><br>
      That day, I was the target. The school clown. They taped things to my back, replaced my books with ripped ones, hid my shoes, and set off alarms in my locker. At lunch, someone dumped milk on my tray and called it an "experiment."
      <br><br>
      I tried to stay strong. I clenched my fists and bit my tongue. But when the final blow came — a fake phone call staged by my classmates saying my mother had been hospitalized — I collapsed. In front of everyone. I remember the gasp, the silence that followed, and then — laughter.
      <br><br>
      I ran.
      Not just out of the room, but out of myself. Out of whatever innocence I had left. I hid in the bathroom stall, trembling, sobbing until I was empty.
      <br><br>
      That night, I didn't sleep. I stared at the ceiling, replaying every moment, every laugh, every face. My chest felt hollow. My thoughts tangled. My trust shattered.
      <br><br>
      The days that followed were blurry. I stopped speaking for a while. My parents didn’t understand. "It was just a joke," they said. "Don’t be so sensitive."
      <br><br>
      But it wasn’t just a joke. It was a war on my spirit.
      <br><br>
      Every year since, as the calendar nears April, something shifts in me. My sleep gets worse. I grow quiet. My body tenses without reason. I check my phone compulsively. I avoid people. I delete social media. I pretend to be sick.
      <br><br>
      April 1st became a dark ritual. A reminder that cruelty can wear a mask of comedy. That some scars are laughed at instead of healed.
      <br><br>
      So I created something. Not to forget — but to remember. To honor that child I used to be. To speak for the ones who still tremble in silence.
      <br><br>
      <strong>AprilFear</strong> is not a meme coin. It’s a symbol. A shadow. A scream that never got answered. A monument built from a broken “1.”
      <br><br>
      It’s for the ones who don’t laugh. The ones who don’t forgive. The ones who carry a weight others never see.
      <br><br>
      If you’ve ever felt like me — if April 1st fills you with dread — know that you are not alone.
      <br><br>
      This is for us.
      This is for the child who hid in the stall.
      This is for the boy who stopped smiling.
      This is for the silence that was never broken.
      <br><br>
      This is <strong>AprilFear</strong>.
